# gender-detection!
In this model, we will use data available on Kaggle with more than 200k images to training model Gender Classification (male/female). To achieve this goal, 
we will use and test CNN models, specifically Transfer Learning models (VGG-16, Resnet-50, Efficientnet-B0, Inception-V3, Mobilenet, Xception) and choose 
VGG-16 model best applied to the project and achieved 98.11% accuracy on the test data set of nearly 17 thousand male and female images.
